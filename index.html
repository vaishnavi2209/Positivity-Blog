	          	<p>From early on we are judged by preconceived standards and pushed into predefined labels. Things happen, we behave in a certain way and suddenly, before we realize it, it becomes who we are. By subconscious interpretation of events and other people’s reactions, we find ourselves defining who we are.</p>

	          			<h2>How to overcome obstacles and frustrations and make the best out of them</h2>
	          	    </a>

	          			Sometimes in life we find ourselves faced with obstacles or situations that we don’t agree with but cannot necessarily do much about. It can be a decision someone else has made that affects you in some way or an unfavorable circumstance. If you’re feeling stuck or frustrated in a situation like this and it seems like your world is falling apart, be aware that regardless of what’s happening, you have control over how you choose to react and therefore, how quickly you pull yourself out of the negative feelings. Below are the steps I use to pull myself up and stay calm and happy whatever obstacle comes my way.First things first, if you’re feeling sad or frustrated, the worst thing you can do is to suppress the strong emotions you are feeling. We live in a society that teaches us that crying or showing emotion is a sign of weakness and vulnerability. The risk this poses is that if you don’t let the emotions out, they start to accumulate inside of you and with time can lead to a serious breakdown or even physical illnesses. So if you need to cry, just cry as much as you need. Let it all out. You will be amazed how relieved you feel afterwards.
